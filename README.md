This creates a simple SOL Clicker game where you can wager SOL and try to win by clicking rapidly. Here's how it works:
You start with 10 SOL.
You can set a wager amount (minimum 1 SOL).
Click "Start Game" to begin.
You have 10 seconds to click the button as many times as possible.
If you click more than 20 times, you win double your wager.
If you don't reach 20 clicks, you lose your wager.
But you cant pass 18 clicks sooner than 8 seconds into the clock.
